### <a id="pricing"></a>What is the pricing policy?
If you don't mind anyone seeing your code, then it's free. If you stick within our Acceptable Usage Policy (which is pretty generous), then it's free. If you want to keep your code private, work in teams or stray outside the Acceptable Usage Policy limitations, then you will need a subscription.

### <a id="organizations"></a>Will there be billing support for organizations?
Yes, there will. One account can pay for other users' subscriptions.

### <a id="golive"></a>When will Codio start charging?
We expect to start charging some time around August 2013.

### <a id="limitations"></a>Are there usage limitations?
There are, although they are not very onerous. Click here to read the Acceptable Usage Policy.
