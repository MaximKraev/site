There are several sites that explain Markdown well. 

- [Bill Powell is Alive](http://billpowellisalive.com/blog/markdown-syntax) does a very neat summary. 
- The full reference is available on the [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html) site. 

We should support most of the Markdown standard. Let us know if you find something unsupported.
