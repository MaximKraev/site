Anyone accessing a Codio project that has annotations can press the [Tour or Explore buttons](/docs/annotations/tour-explore/) to initiate the tour. However, you can also launch a tour automatically via the URL.

When you open up a Codio project, you will see the url of your project, something like this

	http://codio.com/account_name/project_name

Simple append `tour` or `explore` to the end to enter either mode

	http://codio.com/account_name/project_name/tour
	http://codio.com/account_name/project_name/explore
