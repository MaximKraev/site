Codio offers a standard way of [summarizing a project](/docs/ide/ide-general/readme-md) using a readme.md file. When a project is opened, this readme.md file is displayed automatically. 

You may find this a good way of providing an introduction to your tutorial or annotated code samples. Codio will automatically show Tour and Explore buttons if it detects an `annotations.md' file present and it will show special buttons at the top of the readme/info file as well to make it easy for the viewer to start the tour or exploration.
