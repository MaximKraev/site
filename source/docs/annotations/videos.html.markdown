Adding videos, images and links to your annotations can make it easier to learn the subject matter and it's really easy to do using markdown as [described here](/docs/annotations/md-overview/). 

#Image
To insert an image, you need to specify the full path to the image, including the app name itself, for example

`![Bower Logo](app/img/bower-logo.png)`

Do not put a `/` at the start of the image path.

#Video
To insert a YouTube or Vimeo video into your annotations, just use the full URL of the video

	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCWVeouuA1M

The screenshot below shows annotation that shows a few seconds of video that illustrates what happens when the associated code snippet executes. What would otherwise require a lot of head scratching is now much clearer.

You can also feature simple web-cam headshots of yourself explaining something. This makes for a much more personal experience for the student and is very easy to do. In fact, a feature on our roadmap is a video button that let's you record from your webcam direct to your YouTube account.
