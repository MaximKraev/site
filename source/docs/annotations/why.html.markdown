title: Why use Codio Annotations

Normally when people write tutorials or document code samples, it is done like this

1. Add some comments to your source code; too sparse and there is not much help, too much and it messes with your code
1. Write some documentation or a tutorial where you write a lot of text interspersed with some code snippet

This approach is standard and works (if the author is good) but the reader has several challenges

- the longer a tutorial is the harder it is for the user to follow
- you rarely get a complete project that allows you to see everything in context
- if you do get a project, you still have to install it and you still have to flip between the tutorial text and the source
- tutorials usually leave out a lot of interesting and important stuff because it is time-consuming to write
- you can only add so many comments to your source code
- there is no way of adding rich content such as images, videos etc.
- a source code project is a collection of files; there is no natural way to provide guidance about the project itself and its structure.
- you cannot interact with your source file, you can only read them


With Codio:Annotations we have tried to address all of these issues.

##A complete project in a proper IDE
When a user reads a tutorial, what they usually want is to see complete code, not just an extract. The problem with an extracted code snippet is you have no idea of the immediate context of that snippet.

Codio:Annotations lets you create your tutorial in your own IDE but run the annotated project within the Codio web based IDE. 

Any developer will already understand an IDE. The IDE is the logical place to find and explore code. By running your code example in the Codio IDE you immediately have access to learning specific functionality

- [Wiki-like overview pages](/docs/annotations/readme-md/)
- [Guided Tours](/docs/annotations/tour-explore/)
- [Exploring the code and getting help](/docs/annotations/tour-explore/)

##Rich Content
It is very important, especially for novices, to have the learning materials be as easy to read and understand as possible. Yet developer learning materials are often as dry as hell. Codio:Annotations has a lot of two things in particular

- richness - you can add images, videos, sound and nicely formatted text to your annotations making it easier to digest
- interaction - we offer [Tour and Explore modes](/docs/annotations/tour-explore/) that give different types of interactivity, again making it easier an more enjoyable to learn.

##An annotated project is a perfect package
Once you have annotated you code, you can think of it as a perfect, self-contained package. There are several IDE features that then provide even more benefit

- the tutorial is available a a single URL
- your users have a complete sample that can be easily downloaded as a ZIP file
- users can fork your sample and maybe improve it

##Future features
We have an extensive roadmap that will bring more and more features to support teaching and learning of code at any level. We also are very keen to hear your ideas on how we can improve annotations, so don't hold back.
