If you provide access to your project to others, then Codio allows more than one person to edit files at the same time. Rather like Google Docs, you will be able to see other people editing the file in real time.

Because of this collaboration feature, your files are saved in real time and there is no need to press the save button. It just happens automatically.

We will soon be adding viewer lists and personalized cursors so you will be able to see which user is viewing the current file and where they are editing.
