It's safe to assume you know what editing means. However, there are a few things worth noting :

- Codio will syntax highlight based on the file type
- The [Editor Settings](/docs/account-settings/editor) are worth checking out as you can change a lot of things here
- There are plenty of things like Code Collapse, auto-indent
- Codio will error check for you based on the file type and display warnings and errors in the gutter on the left
