When you open up a project in the IDE, Codio will try to locate a file called readme.md in the root of the project. If it finds one, it will display it in the Info tab as shown below.

The readme.md file should be written in markdown format. Here are a couple of references for markdown

- [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) - the author of markdown
