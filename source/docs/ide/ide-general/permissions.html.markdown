You will see the following screen

By default:

- Anyone can see a public project

Changing permissions allows you to give the following access permissions to Users and/or Teams.

- **Read** - View the project only
- **Write** - Edit the project
- **Admin** - Edit the project and make project levels settings changes ([Settings](/docs/ide/ide-general/settings)  and **Permissions**)
