Codio offers dual mode preview.

1. When you press Preview in the top menu bar, an inline preview window will open up.
1. You can then expand that into a full screen preview in its own browser tab by pressing on the icon at the top of the Preview pane.

If you want to refresh the Preview pane, click on Preview again. We will shortly be announcing a hotkey to refresh.
