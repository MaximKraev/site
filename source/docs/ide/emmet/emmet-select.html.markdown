Action is similar to “Go to Edit Point”, but selects important code parts.

In HTML, these are tag name, full attribute and attribute value. For class attribute it also selects distinct classes.

In CSS, it matches selector, full property and property value. For complex values and functions like 1px solid red or url(image.jpg) also selects part of it.
