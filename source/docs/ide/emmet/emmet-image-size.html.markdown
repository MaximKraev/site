Many web-developers forget to write width and height attributes for `<img>` tags which leads to poor UX. This action helps you to automate this process: simply place the cursor inside the `<img>` tag and run this action to add/update width and height attributes.

In CSS, place the cursor inside the property value with the url() function to add/update width and height properties for the current rule.
