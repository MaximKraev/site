All changes to the theme are made in the Editor Settings dialog as [described here](/docs/ide/code-editor/editor-settings/).

You can control what happens if a line of code exceeds the width of the page. This is controlled by the **Soft wrap** property.

- **Free** - the wrapping occurs at the edge of the code window
- **40 Chars** - wraps after 40 characters
- **80 Chars** - wraps after 80 characters
- **Off** - no wrapping
