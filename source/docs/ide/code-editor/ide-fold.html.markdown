All changes to the theme are made in the Editor Settings dialog as [described here](/docs/ide/code-editor/editor-settings/).

Code folding allows you to collapse functions and loops. When you move the mouse into the Gutter (where the line numbers appear) you will see arrows appears wherever code can be folder.

If you click on an arrow, you can expand or collapse the function/loop. Collapsed code is also marked within the code and can be clicked on to expand the code block.
