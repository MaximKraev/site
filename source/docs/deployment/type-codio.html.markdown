title: Codio Target Type

The Codio target type is suitable for all forms of content where no admin access is required on the actual server. There is no ability to install extra components nor is there command line access. If you need full control, then it is recommended you use a 3rd party hosting platform that gives you FTP or SFTP access.

The actual content actually resides on Amazon S3 servers and is therefore very scalable and redundant.

**Important:** please be sure understand the importance of the Source Location (are you deploying a Project, an App or a Directory). [Read about it here](/docs/deployment/create/).
