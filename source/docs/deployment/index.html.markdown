Codio lets you deploy all or any part of your project with a single click to a custom 'deployment target'. Currently, we support deployment to the following platforms.

- [Codio](/docs/deployment/type-codio/) (will require a paid plan once we are out of beta)
- [FTP](/docs/deployment/type-ftp/)
- [SFTP](/docs/deployment/type-sftp/)

We will also be adding the following target types shortly:

- Parse.com
- Nodejitsu
- Heroku
- more by popular request
