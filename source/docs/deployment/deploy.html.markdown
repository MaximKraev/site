When you want to deploy, press the "Deploy" menu item in the top bar and you will be shown a small popup dialog with the most recently used target selected. If you press the "Deploy Now" button, the deploy will execute immediately. You will be shown detailed progress information.

You can also select a different deployment target from the dropdown.

Once the deployment has been successfully executed, you will see the URL required to access the application/site. This URL is also stored and shown both here and in the main Deployment Targets screen.
