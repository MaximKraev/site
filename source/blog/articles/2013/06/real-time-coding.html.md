We have a big new feature for your enjoyment that we rolled out just yesterday. I'm excited to introduce Real Time Coding!

Right from the start, we wanted Codio to be collaborative. We are after all, working in the browser, which is the perfect place to collaborate. So yesterday we flicked the switch on our first big collaborative feature.

Real Time Coding is exactly as it sounds. You and your friends and colleagues can hack away on your code. But when any of your friends or colleagues makes a change in the code, you see it happening right there in real time. You see exactly what they type, as they type it.

It's like Google Docs, but right in your code editor!

Real Time Coding is available right now for everyone, and for all projects.
