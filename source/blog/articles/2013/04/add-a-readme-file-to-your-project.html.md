Hot on the heels of [dragging and dropping files in the file explorer](/blog/2013/04/drag-and-drop-in-the-file-explorer), we've just added another new feature that will really help others find out all they need to know about your projects. Just add a readme file into your project, and it will be shown by default.

![Readme File in your projects](/img/blog/readme.png)

As long as you create a file called `readme` or `readme.txt`, it will be shown in the first tab of the IDE when your project is opened.

And if you want to make your readme look good, use the excellent [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax to give your [readme](https://codio.com/joelmoss/Log/tree/Log/README.md) some [style](https://codio.com/joelmoss/Log). Just use the `md` or `markdown` file extension.
