This TED talk by Sugata Mitra is truly inspirational. It's shows that kids in the digital age can learn incredibly well without any formal teaching when they form communities and use their natural resourcefulness.

Here are four of my favorite parts if you don't have time to watch the whole video

##The hole-in-the-wall computer
Sugata tells the story of how he put a 'hole-in-the-wall' computer, connected to the web, in a small village in India where the kids had never seen a computer and couldn't speak any English. He then went away for 3 months and left them to it. When he came back, the kids had not only collectively figured out how to use the computer, surf the web etc. but they had taught themselves English so they could figure out how to use it.

##Teaching DNA replication to 12 year olds
He deposited a hole-in-the-wall computer in another village and then asked kids to find out all they could about DNA Replication, certain that they would fail at this complex task. They didn't become biochemists but they achieved a 50% score in a test for people 8 years older at a private school in New Delhi with a proper biochemistry teacher.

##The English Accent experiment
An experiment to teach Indian kids to speak English without their usual very strong accents (and therefore improve their job prospects). The solution involved not a second of teaching. He gave them a speech-to-text recognition engine and left them to it. If there accents were not good enough, the computer could not recognize their speech and nothing would come up on screen.

##Conclusion
We believe that there are some important lessons to be learnt from these stories. Kids will learn if they are given some very basic opportunities. If teachers are not available, well never mind. If you add great, modern teachers into the mix, who are capable of teaching not just their class of 30, but a class of 300,000 - now that's teaching.
