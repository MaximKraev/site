We are really happy to announce the release of Codio:Annotations, and we don't think you'll have seen anything quite like this before. It is an amazing way of documenting code where you need to explain things through code examples. Tutorials, APIs, frameworks and libraries are the usual suspects.

##The problem with tutorials
Tutorials, no matter how well they are written require mental leaps as you read large amounts of text, liberally seasoned with code snippets. Here is [a link to a very high quality tutorial](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/events_in_javascript) from webplatform.org. Take a look at it and imagine you have to learn from it. Wouldn't it be great if I had a complete, working project, ready to run and all shown and documented within a proper IDE. Read on.

##What it does
Below is the same material in the Codio IDE with annotations added to it. You can play with the IDE below or [click here](https://codio.com/codio/Oscillating-Spring) to see it full screen. 

Three things you should play around with:

- The blue icons are clickable in the file tree and within a source file; try a few out.
- Press the 'Tour' button at the top and you will be given a guided tour.
- Press 'Preview' and the App will run.

##More to come
This is the very first version and we have a lot more features planned. We are especially keen to get your feedback so please make sure you let us have your comments (comments below or using the envelope icon within the IDE).

##Support our campaign
Codio:Annotations is completely free and we are trying to raise awareness of a campaign we are running to get coding taught in schools. Evil flourishes where good men do nothing (ok, a little melodramatic), so if you think that the state of teaching coding in schools is as terrible as we do, then simply [add your name](/education) to the campaign.
