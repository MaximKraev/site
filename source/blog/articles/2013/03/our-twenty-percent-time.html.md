Tomorrow, for the very first time, the Codio engineering team will be trying something new.

Google is famous for allowing and indeed encouraging its engineers to use 20% of their time to work on anything that they want. This 20% allowance has resulted in Gmail and other popular Google products. So we wanted to try something similar by encouraging our engineers to work on anything that they want. The only proviso is that it must be something related to Codio itself, or something that will benefit the team with their work on Codio.

So tomorrow and then every Friday after, we will be working on whatever the hell we want!

It's exciting and I'm hoping to be able to take part myself as I don't get to do much coding these days. If just one new feature or small bug fix comes out of these, I think it will still be deemed a success. This is not only a way to discover and build new features for Codio, but also as a bonding exercise within the team, and a way to have a little fun with something different.

It's also a great excuse to be free from the daily constraints of picking and working on tickets.

I'll be sure to let you all know how it goes.
