Having watched the [code.org video](http://www.youtube.com/v/nKIu9yen5nc) and seen what they are trying to achieve, we wondered how cool it would be if we could contribute to this initiative in a meaningful way.

Fortunately, we can. We have a great Web IDE and with a little effort, we've got a game changer for the way tutorials, documentation and code samples are delivered. We want this to be a free, web based platform that let's any author of code examples or tutorials deliver their content in a natural way, that doesn't dumb anything down.

To get you interested, take a look below. It's a real and fully functioning IDE. It's fast, doesn't require signup, can be embedded anywhere and is being aggressively developed. However, as a vehicle for providing working code tutorials and examples, it's a great start. Once we've added our annotation features, we think it'll be awesome.

Over the next couple of months (with some <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20web%20platform%20turns%20your%20%23code%20into%20interactive%20tutorials%20%26%20code%20samples.%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fs%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F%20-%20gr8%20for%20%23Education%20%26%20%23developers%20" target="_blank">verbal encouragement</a> from the community) we'll be adding a lot of very cool stuff to Codio, so people can teach and learn in code's natural home - the IDE. You'll be able to add guided tours, rich text explanations that pop-up as you explore the project, audio, and even videos that [for example] show screen output when a piece of code executes.

You'll be able to set this all up from your own IDE as well as within Codio, and it will not interfere with or mess up your code.

## What's the problem with online tutorials?

When I say **tutorial**, I don't mean novice developer tutorials, but also advanced APIs, frameworks, libraries or products.

There are three main issues:

1. The natural environment for a code project or example is an IDE, but tutorials are forced to show code snippets - often lots of them. A bit like <a href="http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/creating_and_modifying_html" target="_blank">this top quality tutorial</a> from webplatform.org. This can mean a lot of mental gymnastics as you read.

1. When I'm learning, there isn't usually any **instant** access to a full, working project, and if there is, it has to be downloaded and installed somewhere. Again, what we would love is instant access to an online or even embedded IDE.

1. Finally, I usually find myself wanting to run the project, then make my own modifications and run it again. Experiment in other words. You rarely have this facility.

If these problems were solved, with interactivity at the heart of it, it would significantly speed up the way new coding material is absorbed and taught.

## Codio:Annotations

That's what we're calling all this. We're going to make the whole teaching/learning process highly interactive and fun for the learners and the authors. Learners will get either guided tours around the project, or be able to explore the code freely, and get information wherever they are looking. We'll have more details very soon.

Here are a few key points about the platform:

- It's a web platform, so instantly accessible for learners.
- Authors and learners can access without needing to signup (no nasty dialogs or screens before you see the code).
- There is no commercial catch - any public tutorial or example is, and always will be, free.
- It's great for absolutely any programming language.
- It has to work beautifully for school pupils, but equally great for highly advanced stuff.
- It will be a great way of adding code samples into any form of API or developer documentation.

## Give us some encouragement

If you like what you are reading, we ask that you encourage us in any way that you feel will help. The best way is to let others know. We're a small company and doing this requires a fair bit of effort. So feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=Codio%20web%20platform%20turns%20your%20%23code%20into%20interactive%20tutorials%20%26%20code%20samples.%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fcodio.com%2Fs%2Fblog%2F2013%2F03%2Fcodio-for-education%2F%20-%20gr8%20for%20%23Education%20%26%20%23developers%20" target=" target="_blank">tweet something nice!</a>
