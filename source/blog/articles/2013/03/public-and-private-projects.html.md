[Last week](/blog/2013/15/collaboration-in-coding) I spoke about what collaboration is, and why it is so important to us all. Today I will take that further with the first in a series of posts introducing the collaborative features of **Codio**.

## People like sharing!

Which is why, in Codio, you will be able to create as many public projects as you like, and every project is either public or private.

  - A **private** project is one which only you can see and edit.
  - **Public** projects are open and visible to everyone.

Regardless of which type of project you have; as the owner, you have full control over who and what can read, write and administrate your project. You can assign permissions to any other Codio users, to allow them to view or edit your private project, or even give them full administrative permissions.

You can also create teams of users, each with its own permissions. So if you want to allow a team of people to only edit your project, you can do that. Or perhaps you want to ensure that your best mate can administer your project.

It's all fast and easy to do.
