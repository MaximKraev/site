Hot on the heels of yesterday's [release of Codio:Deployment](/blog/2013/05/one-click-deployment/) comes a couple of extra goodies for you.

First up is a slight refresh of the UI. We like being trendy and "with it", so we tweaked our colours and made the UI a little flatter. We also decreased the height of the top bars, to give you even more code editing space. This, along with a set of all new clean and crisp icons, means Codio has never looked so HOT!

Second is the much requested ability to quickly and easily switch modes of the file you are looking at, and an updated line and column count. Both these can be found in the status bar at the bottom of the page, when you have a file open. Codio now supports nearly 100 programming languages, and each one is now just a click away. Of course, we will still automatically detect the correct language for you, but just in case we get it wrong, or you simply want to edit your HTML as if it were Haskell (which of course we all want to do), go right ahead and change it.
