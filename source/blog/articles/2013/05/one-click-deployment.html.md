You have always been able to preview your code from right within the Codio IDE, but this ability to preview was never intended to be a hosting solution for your production apps. We have always wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to deploy your apps. So I am very excited to announce our latest new feature that is available right now to all users. Announcing Codio:Deployment - a single click and your app is deployed to your production environment.

Codio:Deployment is available to users with admin permissions on any project. You can create one or more deployment targets, which can be used to setup different environments - perhaps for production and staging. Then any time you are ready to deploy your code, just choose the target you want, and click deploy!

Right now we support deploying your projects over FTP, but we do have immediate plans to allow you to deploy to Parse and NodeJitsu.

However, the easiest and fastest way to get started is to host your code right here with us. Powered by Amazons S3 cloud storage, you can host your client-side apps and static content with us. Just choose the "Codio" deployment destination, and hit deploy. No server to setup, and no complex configuration needed!

Documentation can be found in the [docs](/docs/deployment/), but it's so easy to use, that we recommend you simply dive in and give it a go.

Enjoy!
